Now that we have two pieces of evidence that we can use to match the suspects to the aliases! If only there were some way to combine them. As you finish your drink you think back to class and remember that you can use Bayesian reasoning to combine the evidence! With the mix of your knowledge of bayesian reasoning and python programming skills, hopefully we be able to figure out who was who!"
